# Simple Drawing App

This is just an extremely basic drawing app I made a while back, before I even learned how to use git. You can adjust the color and size of the pencil tool, use an eraser, or clear the entire canvas. When your drawing is finished, you can download it as a PNG file.

As this was an early project, there are obviously a few kinks to work out.
